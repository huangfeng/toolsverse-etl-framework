<body>
<h1>End-User  License Agreement </h1>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY:</strong> This End-User License Agreement  (&quot;EULA) is a legal agreement between Licensee (either an individual or a  single entity) and Toolsverse (&quot;Licensor&quot;), which covers your use of  Data Explorer and related software components (&quot;Software&quot;). </p>
<p>If you do not agree to all of the terms of this EULA, then you  should not download, install and use the Software. If you already downloaded or  installed the Software, you should remove the Software from your system and  destroy all copies.</p>

<h3>1.  Definitions</h3>
<p>&quot;Licensor&quot; means Toolsverse.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensee&quot; means an individual or a legal entity  exercising rights under, and complying with, all of the terms and conditions of  this EULA or any future version of this EULA.</p>
<p>&quot;Software&quot; means the software program known as Data  Explorer and its components in binary form, including its documentation, any  third party software programs that are owned and licensed by parties other than  Licensor and that are either integrated with or made part of Software  (collectively, &quot;Third Party Software&quot;).</p>
<p> &quot;License &quot; means evidence of a license provided by  Licensor to Licensee in electronic form, and defines the optional rights  related to the Software.</p>
<h3>2.  Ownership</h3>
<p>The Software is the property of Licensor. The Software is  licensed, not sold. Title and copyrights to the Software, in whole and in part  and all copies thereof, and all modifications, enhancements, derivatives and  other alterations of the Software regardless of who made any modifications, if  any, are, and will remain, the sole and exclusive property of Licensor.</p>
<h3>3.  Grant of License</h3>
<p>According to the License, Licensor grants Licensee a  non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software, and subsequent  versions thereof, under certain obligations and limited rights as set forth in  this EULA:</p>
<p><strong>Licensee may:</strong></p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>use the Software       for commercial and non-commercial use.</li>
  <li>use each License       on more than one computer system, as long as it is always used by the same user. Each additional user of the Software requires an additional License.</li>
  <li>make copies of       the Software and the License as reasonably necessary for the use       authorized by this EULA, including as needed for backup and/or archival       purposes. No other copies may be made. Each copy must reproduce all       copyright and other proprietary rights notices on or in the Software       Product. </li>
</ul>
<h3>4.  Evaluation License</h3>
<p>A time-limited version of the Software, an Evaluation License, is  provided for a period of twenty (20) days (&quot;Evaluation Period&quot;) from  the date of first use of the Software. The time limited version is subject to  all terms set forth in this EULA with the exception that the Evaluation License  is not for general commercial use.
  The Software contains a feature that will automatically disable  the commercial components of the Software after the Evaluation Period has  expired. Licensee may not disable, destroy, or remove this feature of the  Software, and any attempt to do so will be in violation of this EULA and  immediately terminate this agreement.</p>
<h3>5.  License Restrictions</h3>
<p><strong>Licensee may not:</strong></p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>reverse engineer,       decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, make any attempt to discover       the source code of the Software in whole or in part.</li>
  <li>distribute, copy,       publish, assign, sell, bargain, convey, transfer, pledge, lease or grant       any further rights to use the Software.</li>
  <li>modify or create       derivative work based Software in whole or in part.</li>
  <li>tamper with,       alter, disable or circumvent the Software's built-in license verification       and enforcement capabilities.</li>
  <li>remove or alter       any trademark, copyright, logo or other proprietary notices in the       Software.</li>
  <li>disclose the       License in any way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6.  Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
<p>Unless specified in this EULA, all express or implied  conditions, representations and warranties, including any implied warranty of  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement are  disclaimed, except to the extent that these disclaimers are held to be legally  invalid.</p>
<h3>7.  Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event will Licensor  (or any third-party developer) be liable for any lost revenue, profit or data,  or for special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages,  however caused regardless of the theory of liability, arising out of or related  to the use of or inability to use Software, even if Licensor has been advised  of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p> In no event will Licensor's liability to Licensee, whether in  contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by  Licensee for Software under this EULA. The foregoing limitations will apply  even if the above stated warranty fails in its essential purpose. Some states  do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of  the terms above may not be applicable to Licensee.</p>
<h3>8.  Termination</h3>
<p>This EULA is effective until terminated. Licensee may terminate  this EULA at any time by destroying all copies of Software.</p>
<p> Licensee agrees that upon termination of this EULA for any  reason, Licensor may take actions so that Software no longer operates.</p>
<h3>9.  Integration</h3>
<p>This EULA, including License, is the entire agreement between  Licensee and Licensor relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior  or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations  and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any  quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties  relating to its subject matter during the term of this EULA. No modification of  this EULA will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative  of each party.</p>
<h3>10.  Third Party Software</h3>
<p>Additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to  portions of the Software are set forth in the doc/credits.html file and in the  lib, plugin and jdbc directories.</p>
